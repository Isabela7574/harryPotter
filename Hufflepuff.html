            <h1>Hufflepuff!</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>Hufflepuff values hard work, patience, justice, and loyalty. The house mascot is the badger,
            and canary yellow and black are its colours. During the books, the Head of this house is the Herbology
            Professor Pomona Sprout, and the house ghost is The Fat Friar. According to Rowling, Hufflepuff corresponds
            roughly to the element of earth. The founder of this house is Helga Hufflepuff. The entrance to the Hufflepuff
            dormitories and common room entrance is concealed in a pile of large barrels in an alcove in the corridor that
            holds the kitchen. To enter, one must tap the barrel two from the bottom in the middle of the second row in the
            rhythm of "Helga Hufflepuff". Unlike any other house, the Hufflepuff common room has a repelling device that douses
            the illegal entrant in vinegar if the wrong lid is tapped or the rhythm is wrong.[24] The Hufflepuff common room is
            filled with yellow hangings and fat armchairs and it has little underground tunnels leading to the dormitories, all of
            which have perfectly round doors, like barrel tops.[25]</p>
