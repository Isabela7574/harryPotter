            <p>Hermione Jean Granger is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.
            She first appears in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as a new student on her way to Hogwarts.
            After Harry and Ron save her from a mountain troll in the girls' restroom, she becomes best friends with them and often
            uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to help them in really bad situations. J.K Rowling has stated
            that Hermione resembles herself as a young girl, with her insecurity and fear of failure.
            The character has had immense popularity. The version of Hermione portrayed by Emma Watson in
            all eight Harry Potter films from Philosopher's Stone in 2001 to Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 2 in 2011 was voted the best
