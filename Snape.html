            <br><br>
            <p>Severus Snape is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.
            He is an exceptionally skilful wizard whose coldly sarcastic and controlled exterior
            conceals deep emotions and anguish. A Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
            Snape is hostile to Harry due to his resemblance to his father James, who bullied Snape during
            their time at Hogwarts.</p>
