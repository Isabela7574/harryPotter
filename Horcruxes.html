            <br><br>
            <p>A Horcrux is an object used to store part of a person's soul,
            protecting him or her from death. If the body of a Horcrux owner is killed, that
            portion of the soul that had remained in the body does not pass on to the next world,
            but will rather exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being resurrected by another wizard,
            as stated in Half-Blood Prince. If all of someone's Horcruxes are destroyed, then the soul's only anchor
            in the material world would be the body, the destruction of which would then cause final death.
            The creation of Horcruxes is considered the darkest of all magic.</p>
