            <h1>Dark Mark!</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>The Dark Mark is the symbol of Voldemort and the Death Eaters and takes the
            form of a skull with a snake coming out of the mouth in place of a tongue.
            The mark is cast into the sky by Death Eaters whenever they have murdered someone.
            The spell used by Death Eaters to conjure the Mark is Morsmordre. It first appears
            in Goblet of Fire and is described as a "colossal skull, composed of what looked like
            emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue". Once in the
            sky it was "blazing in a haze of greenish smoke". Dark Marks are also branded on the
            left forearm of the closest followers of Voldemort. The mark serves as a connection
            between Voldemort and each who bears it; he can summon them by touching his mark,
            causing it and those of his followers to burn and change colour. Death Eaters can
            summon Voldemort in the same fashion. Following Voldemort's ultimate defeat, the
            Dark Marks on his Death Eaters fade into a scar "similar" to Harry's.[14] In the books,
            the Dark Mark is described as green; however, in the films, it was only green at the
            Quidditch World Cup. In all other film appearances it has been grey.</p>
